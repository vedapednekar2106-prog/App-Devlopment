# Experiment 7

## Experiment Aim
Create a registration form with multiple fields (text, radio buttons, dropdowns) and use UI/UX.

## Objective
To design a mobile-friendly, user-friendly registration form using Figma that includes text fields, radio buttons, and dropdowns, while ensuring good UI/UX practices.

## Steps Followed
1. **Planned the Form Structure**
   - Fields required: Full Name, Email, Gender (Radio buttons), Country (Dropdown), Terms & Conditions checkbox, and Sign Up button.

2. **Created the Layout in Figma**
   - Added text fields for **Name** and **E-mail** with placeholder text.
   - Designed **radio buttons** for Gender selection (Female, Male, Other).
   - Created a **dropdown menu** for Country selection.
   - Added a checkbox for **terms and privacy policy agreement**.
   - Placed a clear **Sign Up button** at the bottom.

3. **Applied UI/UX Principles**
   - Used proper spacing and alignment for readability.
   - Applied consistent typography and rounded input fields for a modern look.
   - Highlighted the primary action button (Sign Up) with a bold color (purple).
   - Ensured contrast between background and input fields.

4. **Prototyping**
   - Made interactive elements (radio buttons, checkbox, dropdown) behave as expected.

## Expected Output
- A **mobile registration form** containing:
  - Text fields: Name, Email
  - Radio buttons: Gender selection
  - Dropdown: Country selection
  - Checkbox: Terms & Conditions
  - Submit button: Sign Up
- The design should be:
  - Clean and visually appealing
  - Easy to navigate and understand
  - Mobile-responsive and user-friendly

## Conclusion
The registration form was successfully designed in **Figma**, showcasing multiple input types (text fields, radio buttons, dropdowns, and checkbox) in a clean, modern interface. The experiment demonstrates how to combine UI components while applying UI/UX principles such as spacing, alignment, contrast, and visual hierarchy.
